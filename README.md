# Pok-mon-Elo-Rating-System
The Pok√©mon series has multiple battle formats/activities that all could benefit from an Elo rating system. The math behind the rating system can easily be calculated using a Python script. The script takes the activities &amp; assigns a score to each, and then compiles an average score for the player.
